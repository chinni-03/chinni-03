## 👀 Who dis?

Hi! I’m Harshini. I write code that usually works on the second try. I’m a Computer Science graduate who accidentally fell in love with **full-stack development** and now spends a little too much time perfecting pixels *and* endpoints.

Sometimes I build cool things like:
- 🧠 Smart platforms
- 📱 Pretty apps
- 🤖 Machines that do (some of) the thinking
- 💥 Bugs (but only occasionally... okay, maybe more than occasionally)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Toolbox (a.k.a. things I fight with daily)

- **Frontend:** React, Flutter, HTML, CSS (and whatever Bootstrap hasn't broken today)
- **Backend:** Spring Boot, Node.js, Express (for when I want to feel in control)
- **Languages I pretend to master:** Python, Java, JavaScript
- **Databases:** MySQL, MongoDB, Hive (because life’s better with persistent memory)
- **Dev Tools:** Git, GitHub, Postman, VS Code, Docker (just enough to sound impressive)
